# Lint PR Title

The workflow will check pull request title if it follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) strategy.

More info on underlying GitHub Action can be found here [Semantic Pull Request](https://github.com/amannn/action-semantic-pull-request).

**To add the workflow into your repository** copy the [prepared file](https://github.com/Netcracker/.github/blob/main/workflow-templates/pr-lint-title.yaml) into `.github/workflows` directory of your repository.
